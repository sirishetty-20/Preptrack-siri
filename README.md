# 📘 PrepTrack – Placement Preparation Performance Analyzer

## 📌 Project Overview

PrepTrack is a Python console application that analyzes a student's placement preparation performance based on attendance, project completion, profile verification, and daily coding practice scores.

The application validates user input, evaluates performance, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and determines whether the student is ready for placement activities such as mock interviews.

## ✨ Features

- Collects student details
  - Student Name
  - Registration Number
  - Graduation Year
  - Attendance Percentage
  - Project Completion Status
  - Profile Verification Status

- Validates all user inputs
  - Non-empty student name
  - Graduation year between 2025–2027
  - Attendance between 0–100%
  - Accepts only "yes" or "no" for Boolean inputs
  - Accepts only scores between 0–100 or -1 for absence

- Processes seven days of coding practice

- Classifies each practice score into:
  - Strong (75–100)
  - Satisfactory (60–74)
  - Needs Improvement (40–59)
  - Critical (0–39)

- Calculates
  - Total Score
  - Average Score
  - Attempted Days
  - Absent Days
  - Passed Days
  - Failed Days

- Identifies
  - Highest Practice Score
  - Lowest Practice Score
  - First Critical Score

- Evaluates placement readiness using multiple eligibility conditions.

- Displays a detailed performance report.

- Attendance is at least 75%
- At least 6 practice sessions attempted
- Average score is at least 70
- No critical score (<40)
- At least 4 passed practice days
- Required project completed
- Student profile verified
